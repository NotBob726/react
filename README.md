# Mini project "Interactive-Rating"

The project was completed as part of the [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home) challenge

Detailed information about the challenge can be found [here:](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI)

The mini-project was created using the **React**:rocket: library

The basis was to take functional components and the following hooks:
* useState
* useReducer (I could do without it, but I decided to practice)
* UseContext

React-Spring library was used for animation
