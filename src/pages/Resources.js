            <div>
            <p>This book for kids (and grown-ups too) follows Corey on a journey that begins with problems caused by his color confusion.&nbsp; <br></br>“This one-of-a-kind story and fact book begins with Corey’s Story. Corey, a fourth-grader, explains how his color deficiency caused problems in kindergarten. A trip to the eye doctor reveals the problem. Corey’s color confusion is a physical condition that many people share and it has nothing to do with how smart he is.
            Once he understands his color vision, Corey sails past color-dependent obstacles with a positive attitude and confident communication. Color Vision Deficiency isn’t the end of the world, says Corey. It’s just a different view of it!”&nbsp;
